# HVAC Energy Model

*A lightweight Python tool for simulating the thermal behaviour and energy use of a **single-zone** HVAC (Heating, Ventilation & Air-Conditioning) system.*

This model predicts:

* Indoor **air temperature**
* **Wall** (thermal-mass) temperature
* **COâ‚‚** concentration  
* Instant **power draw (kW)** and cumulative **energy (kWh)**

based on building parameters plus time-series inputs such as outdoor weather and occupancy.

## âœ¨ Features

| Feature | What it does | Quick note |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Dynamic simulation** | Uses a **3R-2C** (three-resistance, two-capacitance) thermal network to track heat flows every time-step. | Captures both short-term spikes and wall-mass lag. |
| **HVAC control logic** | Simple on/off thermostat that holds a user-defined set-point. | Easy to swap in MPC later. |
| **Indoor-air-quality model** | Generates COâ‚‚ from occupants and removes it via infiltration/ventilation. | One well-mixed box ODE. |
| **Energy accounting** | Logs instant power and integrates to kWh. | Compressor power = load Ã· COP; fan power follows the cube law. |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1 Â· Install requirements

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

### 2 Â· Run a 24-hour synthetic demo
```bash
python run.py
```
The script prints the first few rows to the console and writes a full
data/results/synthetic_run_results.csv.
